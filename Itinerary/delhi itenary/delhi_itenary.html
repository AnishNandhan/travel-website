                                On the 2nd day of the tour, you will embark on the sightseeing tour of Delhi after having a scrumptious breakfast. Delhi, the capital of India is a city whose every corner reeks of history and culture. The narrow lanes of old Delhi hold many mysteries that are waiting eagerly for someone to unravel them.
                                <ul>
                                    <li>You can taste some authentic mouthwatering Delhi street food or shop at the fabulous Chandni Chowk. Delhi is a city that never fails to delight.</li>
                                    <li>
                                        Humayun's Tomb is a magnificent structure built by the wife of Humayun, Bega Begum by commissioning Persian architects
                                        </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Red sandstone is used on a large scale in this architectural delight and this is the first building in India, where the Charbagh (four squared gardens with water flowing between them) style of landscaping is done.                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Although some four centuries old, the Red Fort still has the elegance to sweep you off your feet. The powerful Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan built the Red Fort as the main palace of the Royal Family.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Built in 1193 by Qutbuddin Aibak, Qutub Minar is a 73-meter brick minaret and is an architectural feat in itself.</li>
                                   <li>The 42 meter India Gate is almost similar to its French counterpart and commemorates the bravery and sacrifice of 70000 Indian as well as British soldiers who lost their lives fighting for the British armed forces during World War I.</li>
                                <li>The Baha'i Temple or the Lotus Temple is another exquisite monument donning the landscape of Delhi. The peculiar thing about this lotus-shaped temple is that people from all religions are welcome here. Rajghat is the place where Mahatma Gandhi was cremated. Spend some quiet moments here.</li>
                            <li>Later in the evening, return to the hotel. Overnight stay at the hotel in Delhi.

                                On day 4 of your Golden Triangle Luxury Tour, after finishing our delicious breakfast we move towards artistry in the Taj Mahal. Thousands of workers worked for 22 years straight and an entire city was established to house these workers so that they could complete Shah Jahan's masterpiece.
                                <ul>

                                        We proceed towards the Agra Fort then. This towering structure was built by Akbar as a place where the royal family would stay. Akbar's love for red sandstone is evident in this fort in the most elegant manner.

                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        Later Mughal rulers, Shah Jahan and Jehangir ornamented the fort with exquisite materials like Belgian glass and white marble. Containing two massive gates, the Delhi Gate and the Lahore Gate, the Agra Fort is the culmination of Mughal military architecture. Many Hindu temples can be found in the fort, reminding us about the secular part of this great nation.
